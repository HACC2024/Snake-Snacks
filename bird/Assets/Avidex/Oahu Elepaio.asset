    brown above, whitish below, and have white wingbars, rump, and tail tips. Immatures
    are reddish brown and have buffy wingbars. Uncommon and local on Oahu, more numerous
    in valleys. Bold and curious; not afraid of people and may follow hikers. Often
    holds tail cocked up at an angle. Male song is a shrill \u201CEl-eh-pie-oh\u201D
