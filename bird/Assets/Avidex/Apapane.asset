    islands. Smaller and darker red than the Iiwi, with a shorter black bill and

    in native forest at high elevations and also occurs at lower elevations in some
    areas where it usually stays high in the forest canopy. Large numbers may congregate
    in a flowering tree. Sometimes holds the tail cocked up. Often flies in flocks,
    sometimes high above the forest. Song consists of 2\u20133 soft notes followed
    by a reedy trill: \u201Cdee-der-di-di-di-di.\u201D"
