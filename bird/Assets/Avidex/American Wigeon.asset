  Species_Description: 'Breeding males have obvious white blaze on forehead and broad
    green slash behind eye. Females are plainer brown with rusty sides. Females are
    very difficult to distinguish from female Eurasian Wigeon; note colder grayish-brown
    head on American that contrasts with warmer orangey sides. Also look for brighter
    white, not gray, underwings in flight, but this can be difficult to judge, especially
    at a distance. Widespread and common in North America, occasionally wintering
    as far south as northern South America. Typically in flocks on lakes and wetlands,
    often grazing in nearby fields. Regular vagrant to Europe. '
