  Species_Description: Elegant seabird with extremely long wings and forked tail.
    Adults are pale gray with white cheek, black cap, and red bill and legs. Very
    similar to Common Tern; note shorter bill, shorter legs, gray belly, and paler
    gray wingtips with very limited dark tips. Young birds show partial black cap
    and black bill and legs; look for pale gray wingtips and stubbier legs to separate
    from Common Tern. Rarely seen away from breeding grounds on coastal islands or
    small ponds in the Arctic tundra. Migrates offshore, heading for wintering grounds
    in Southern Hemisphere.
