  Species_Description: Unmistakable large black swan with a red bill. When swimming
    this species is almost entirely black. Wings show extensive white flight feathers
    when flying. Juveniles are similar but dark-gray. In Australia, compare with
    Magpie Goose, which has white belly, and white underwing with black tips. Typically
    found along inland waterways, rivers, sewage ponds, and coastal lagoons and inlets.
    Sometimes flocks together in enormous numbers on large wetlands.
